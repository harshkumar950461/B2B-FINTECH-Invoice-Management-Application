## üóíÔ∏è Introduction to B2B Operations

The B2B world operates differently from the B2C or C2C world. Businesses work with other businesses on credit. When a buyer business orders something from the seller business, the seller business issues an invoice for that order. This invoice contains various information like the details of the goods purchased and when they should be paid.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

- In the ideal world, the buyer business should payback within the stipulated time (i.e. the Payment Term). However, in the real world, the buyer business seldom pays within their established time frame, and this is where the Account receivables Department comes into picture.
- Every business consists of a dedicated Account receivables Department to collect and track payment of invoices.
- It consists of a Account receivables team that is responsible for:
    - Collecting payments from customers for their past due invoices.
    - Sending reminders and follow ups to the customers for payments to be made.
    - Looking after the entire process of getting the cash inflow.
    - Help the company get paid for the services and products supplied.
- Build a Machine Learning Model to predict the payment date of an invoice when it gets created in the system.
- Build a full stack Invoice Management Application

## PURPOSE  
In real-world scenarios, the invoices are not 
always cleared i.e. paid in full amount by the
due date. So the purpose of my project is to
help the Account Receivables team by collecting 
payments from customers for their past dues,
sending reminders and follow-ups to the customers 
for payments to be made, and help the company get
paid for the services and products supplied

## Project Implementation


### SQL + JAVA + REACTJS - APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT
The application development part is related to building a web-based application that consists of a frontend dashboard displaying the data in a tabular form with different options like add, delete, edit and predict, connected to a backend database. We have created a beautiful user interface to add, edit, delete, print, and most importantly, predict order invoices with ReactJS. For this we have followed certain steps :
- <b>Loading of Data in the Database</b>
- The data was loaded in the database using SQLYOG and all tables and queries were created and successfully displayed. This was done by creating a raw CSV reader module from scratch. This module can read CSV files and can process the data to input into the database with the help of the JDBC Driver class.

## Conclusion
During the tenure of my training at HighRadius, I had exposure to various technical languages which helped in shaping my analytical and problem-solving skills as well as provide knowledge that could be applicable in real-time projects as well. By making the Order Management System I was able to learn how a flow of code works and how to establish connections between different languages.


## Future Work
With the help of AI-Enabled Fintech B2B Order Management Application the organizations, companies, and in fact, individuals can keep track of the payment of their orders irrespective of a large number of clients. This will not only reduce time but also provide a functional manner for the proper functioning of an organization and/or workplace.
